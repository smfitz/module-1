# UNC-BC-MOD-1_CHALNG.

This is the first challenge part of the UNC coding boot camp and it
focusred on adding support to a pre-made and designed website that would
make it accessible to anyone wishing to view the webpage.

To achive this I first divided the CSS file according to sections that
were styling specfic parts of the website

Next to make the webpage more accessible I added alt tags to each image
so that those with vision disablities can access this page easily.

Getting sections to not distrupt the design of the website was tricky
but after adding that along with all of the other semantic features
the website is now supportive of all users.
